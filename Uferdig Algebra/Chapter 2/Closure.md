> Let $\ast$ be a [[Binary operation|binary operation]] on $S$ and let $H$ be a [[Delmengde|subset]] of $S$. The subset $H$ is closed under $\ast$ if for all $a,b \in H$ we also have $a\ast b \in H$. In this case, the binary operation on $H$ given by restricting $\ast$ to $H$ is the induced operation of $\ast$ on $H$.
