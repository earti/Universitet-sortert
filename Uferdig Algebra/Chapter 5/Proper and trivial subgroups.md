> If $G$ is a [[Group|group]], then the [[Subgroup|subgroup]] consisting of $G$ itself is the improper subgroup of $G$. All other subgroups are proper subgroups. The subgroup of only the [[Identitetselement|identity element]] $\{e\}$ is the trivial subgroup of $G$. All other subgroups are nontrivial.
