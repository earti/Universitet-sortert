> If a [[Delmengde|subset]] $H$ of a [[Group|group]] $G$ is [[Closure|closed]] under the [[Binary operation|binary operation]] of $G$ and if $H$ with the induced operation from $G$ is itself a group, then $H$ is a subgroup of $G$. We shall let $H \leq G$ or $G \geq H$ denote that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, and $H < G$ or $G > H$ shall mean $H \leq G$ but $H \neq G$.

> $$\langle \mathbb{Q}, \cdot \rangle \nleq \langle\mathbb{R},+\rangle$$
