> Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and let $a \in G$. Then the [[Subgroup|subgroup]] $\{a^{n} |n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ of $G$ is called the cyclic subgroup of $G$ generated by $a$, and denoted by $\langle a\rangle$ .

Theorem 5.17
Let $G$ be a group and let $a\in G$. Then
$$H =\{a^{n}|n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$
 is a subgroup of $G$ and is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $a$, that is, every subgroup containing $a$ contains $H$.
