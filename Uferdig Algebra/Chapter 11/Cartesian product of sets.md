> The Cartesian product of [[Mengde|sets]] $S_{1},S_{2},\ldots, S_{n}$ is the set of all ordered $n$-tuples $(a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$, where $a_{i} \in S_{i}, i = 1,2,\ldots,n$. The Cartesian product is denoted by either $S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \cdots\times S_{n}$ or by $\Pi_{i=1}^{n}=S_{i}$.
