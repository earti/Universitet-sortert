> Let $r_{1},r_{2},\ldots,r_{n}$ be positive [[Tallmengder|integers]]. Their least common multiple (abbreviated lcm) is the positive [[Generator|generator]] of the cyclic group of all common multiples of the $r_i$, that is, the cyclic group of all integers divisible by each $r_{i}$ for $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$.
