> Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and let $a_{i} \in G$ for $i\in I$. The smallest [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$ containing ${a_{i} |i \in I\}$ is the [[Generated cyclic subgroup|subgroup generated]] by $\{a_{i} |i \in I\}$. If this subgroup is all of $G$, then $\{a_{i} |i \in I}$ generates $G$ and the $a_{i}$ are [[Generator|generators]] of $G$. If there is a finite [[Mengde|set]] $\{a_{i} |i \in I\}$ that generates $G$, then $G$ is finitely generated.
