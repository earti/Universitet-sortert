If $G$ is a [[Group|group]] with [[Binary operation|binary operation]] $\ast$, then the left and right cancellation laws hold in $G$, that is, $a \ast b = a \ast c$ implies $b = c$, and $b \ast a = c \ast a$ implies $b = c$ for all $a,b,c \in G$.
If $G$ is a [[Group|group]] with [[Binary operation|binary operation]] $\ast$, and if $a$ and $b$ are any elements of $G$, then the linear equations $a \ast x = b$ and $y \ast a = b$ have unique solutions $x$ and $y$ in $G$.
In a [[Group|group]] $G$ with [[Binary operation|binary operation]] $\ast$, there is only one element $e$ in $G$ such that $e \ast x = x \ast e=x$ for all $x \in G$. Likewise for each $a \in G$, there is only one element $a$ in $G$ such that $a'\ast a =a\ast a'=e$. In summary, the identity element and inverse of each element are unique in a group.
