The [[Intersection of sets|intersection]] of some [[Subgroup|subgroups]] $H_i$ of a [[Group|group]] $G$ for $i \in I$ is again a subgroup of $G$.
If $G$ is a [[Group|group]] and $a_i \in G$ for $i \in I$, then the [[Subgroup|subgroup]] $H$ of $G$ generated by $\{a_{i} |i \in I\}$ has as elements precisely those elements of $G$ that are finite products of integral powers of the $a_{i}$, where powers of a fixed $a_{i}$ may occur several times in the product.
