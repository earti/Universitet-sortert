Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] of [[Order of groups|order]] $p_{n}$ and let $X$ be a finite $G$-set. Then $|X|\equiv |X_{G}|\mod p$.
(Cauchyâ€™s Theorem) Let $p$ be a [[Primtall|prime]]. Let $G$ be a finite [[Group|group]] and let $p$ divide $|G|$. Then $G$ has an element of [[Order of groups|order]] $p$ and, consequently, a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of order $p$. 
(First Sylow Theorem) Let $G$ be a finite [[Group|group]] and let $|G|=p^{n}m$ where $n \geq 1$ and where $p$ does not divide $m$. Then 
1. $G$ contains a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of [[Order of groups|order]] $p^{i}$ for each $i$ where $1 \leq i \leq n$,
2. Every subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^{i}$ is a [[Normal|normal]] subgroup of a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i < n$.
(Second Sylow Theorem) Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be [[Sylow p-subgroup|Sylow p-subgroups]] of a finite group $G$. Then $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are [[Automorphism and conjugation|conjugate]] subgroups of $G$.
(Third Sylow Theorem) If $G$ is a finite [[Group|group]] and $p$ divides $|G|$, then the number of Sylow $p$-[[Subgroup|subgroups]] is congruent to $1$ modulo $p$ and divides $|G|$.
