Let $\phi : G \to G$ be a [[Group|group]] [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] with [[Kernel of homomorphism|kernel]] $H$. Then the [[Coset of subgroup|cosets]] of $H$ form a [[Factor group|factor group]], $G/H$, where $(aH)(bH) = (ab)H$. Also, the map $\mu : G/H\to\phi[G]$ defined by $\mu(aH) = \phi(a)$ is an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]]. Both coset multiplication and $\mu$ are well defined, independent of the choices $a$ and $b$ from the cosets.
Let $H$ be a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of a [[Group|group]] $G$. Then [[Coset of subgroup|left coset]] multiplication is well defined by the equation $(aH)(bH) = (ab)H$ if and only if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.
Let $H$ be a normal [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$. Then $\gamma : G \to G/H$ given by $\gamma(x) = xH$ is a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] with [[Kernel of homomorphism|kernel]] $H$.
(The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem) Let $\phi : G \to G$ be a group [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] with [[Kernel of homomorphism|kernel]] $H$. Then $\phi[G]$ is a [[Group|group]], and $\mu : G/H \to \phi[G]$ given by $\mu(gH) = \phi(g)$ is an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]]. If $\gamma : G \to G/H$ is the homomorphism given by $\gamma(g) = gH$, then $\phi(g) = \mu \gamma(g)$ for each $g \in G$.

The following are three equivalent conditions for a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] $H$ of a [[Group|group]] $G$ to be a normal subgroup of $G$. 
1. $ghg^{−1} \in H$ for all $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. 
2. $gHg^{−1} \in H$ for all $g ∈ G$. 
3. $gH= Hg$ for all $g \in G$. 
Condition (2) is often taken as the definition of a normal subgroup $H$ of a group $G$.
