Let $G_{1},G_{2},\ldots,G_{n}$ be [[Group|groups]]. For $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{n})$ in $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$, define $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{n})$ to be the element $(a_{1}b_{1},a_{2}b_{2},\ldots,a_{n}b_{n})$. Then $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is a group, the direct product of the groups Gi, under this [[Binary operation|binary operation]].
The [[Group|group]] $\mathbb{Z}_{m}\times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is [[Cycle and cycle length|cyclic]] and is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are [[Relativt primiske tall|relatively prime]], that is, the $\gcd$ of $m$ and $n$ is $1$.
Let $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}) \in \Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. If $a_{i}$ is of finite order $r_{i}$ in $G_{i}$, then the order of $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ in $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is equal to the [[Least common multiple|least common multiple]] of all the $r_{i}$.
