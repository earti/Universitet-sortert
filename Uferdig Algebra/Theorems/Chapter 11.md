Let $G_{1},G_{2},\ldots,G_{n}$ be [[Group|groups]]. For $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{n})$ in $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$, define $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})(b_{1},b_{2},\ldots,b_{n})$ to be the element $(a_{1}b_{1},a_{2}b_{2},\ldots,a_{n}b_{n})$. Then $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is a group, the direct product of the groups Gi, under this [[Binary operation|binary operation]].
The [[Group|group]] $\mathbb{Z}_{m}\times \mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is [[Cycle and cycle length|cyclic]] and is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to $\mathbb{Z}_{mn}$ if and only if $m$ and $n$ are [[Relativt primiske tall|relatively prime]], that is, the $\gcd$ of $m$ and $n$ is $1$.
Let $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}) \in \Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$. If $a_{i}$ is of finite order $r_{i}$ in $G_{i}$, then the order of $(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ in $\Pi_{i=1}^{n} G_{i}$ is equal to the [[Least common multiple|least common multiple]] of all the $r_{i}$.
(Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups) Every [[Finite generation|finitely generated]] [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Group|group]] $G$ is [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a direct product of [[Cycle and cycle length|cyclic]] groups in the form $Z_{(p_{1})^{r_{1}}} \times Z_{(p_{2})^{r_{2}}} \times\cdots\times Z_{(p_{n})^{r_{n}}} \times Z\times \cdots\times Z$,  wherethe $p_{i}$ are [[Primtall|primes]], not necessarily distinct, and the $r_{i}$ are positive [[Tallmengder|integers]]. The direct product is unique except for possiblere arrangement of the factors; that is, the number (Betti number of $G$) of factors $\mathbb{Z}$ is unique and the prime powers $(p_{i})^{r_{i}}$  are unique.)

The finite indecomposable [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Group|groups]] are exactly the [[Cycle and cycle length|cyclic]] groups with [[Order of groups|order]] a power of a prime.

If $m$ divides the [[Order of groups|order]] of a [[Finite generation|finite]] [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Group|group]] $G$, then $G$ has a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of order $m$.
If $m$ is a square free integer, that is, $m$ is not divisible by the square of any [[Primtall|prime]], then every [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Group|group]] of [[Order of groups|order]] $m$ is [[Cycle and cycle length|cyclic]].
