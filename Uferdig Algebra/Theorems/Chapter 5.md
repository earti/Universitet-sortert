A [[Delmengde|subset]] $H$ of a [[Group|group]] $G$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$ if and only if 
1. $H$ is [[Closure|closed]] under the [[Binary operation|binary operation]] of $G$, 
2. the [[Identitetselement|identity element]] $e$ of $G$ is in $H$, 
3. for all $a \in H$ it is true that $a^{âˆ’1} \in H$ also.
Let $G$ be a [[Group|group]] and let $a \in G$. Then $H =\{a^{n}|n \in Z\}$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$ and is the smallest subgroup of $G$ that contains $a$, that is, every subgroup containing $a$ contains $H$.
