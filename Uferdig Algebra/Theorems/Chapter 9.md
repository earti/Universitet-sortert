Every [[Permutasjon|permutation]] $\sigma$ of a finite [[Mengde|set]] is a product of [[Disjunksjon x|disjoint]] [[Cycle and cycle length|cycles]].
No [[Permutasjon|permutation]] in $S_{n}$ can be expressed both as a product of an even number of [[Transposition|transpositions]] and as a product of an odd number of transpositions.
If $n \geq 2$, then the collection of all [[Even and odd permutations|even permutations]] of $\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}$ forms a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of [[Order of groups|order]] $\frac{n!}{2}$ of the symmetric [[Group|group]] $S_{n}$.
