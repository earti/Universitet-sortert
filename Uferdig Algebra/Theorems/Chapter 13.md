Let $\phi$ be a [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]] of a [[Group|group]] $G$ into a group $G'$. 
1. If $e$ is the [[Identitetselement|identity element]] in $G$, then $\phi(e)$ is the identity element $e$ in $G$. 
2. If $a \in G$, then $\phi(a−1) = \phi(a)^{−1}$.
3. If $H$ is a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of $G$, then $\phi[H]$ is a subgroup of $G$. 
4. If $K$ is a subgroup of $G\cap \phi[G]$, then $\phi^{−1}[K]$ is a subgroup of $G$. 
Loosely speaking, $\phi$ preserves the identity element, inverses, and subgroups.

Let $\phi : G \to G'$ be a [[Group|group]] [[Homomorphism|homomorphism]], and let $H = \ker(\phi)$. Let $a \in G$. Then the [[Mengde|set]] $\phi^{-1}[\{\phi(a)\}] =\{x \in G |\phi(x) = \phi(a)\}$ is the [[Coset of subgroup|left coset]] $aH$ of $H$, and is also the right coset $Ha$ of $H$. Consequently, the two [[Partisjon|partitions]] of $G$ into left cosets and into right cosets of $H$ are the same.
