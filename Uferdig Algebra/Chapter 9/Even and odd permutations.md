> [!abstract] %%Oppsummering%%
> A [[Permutasjon|permutation]] of a finite [[Mengde|set]] is even or odd according to whether it can be expressed as a product of an even number of [[Transposition|transpositions]] or the product of an odd number of transpositions, respectively.

> [!example] %%Eksempel%%
> The identity permutation $\iota$ in $S_{n}$ is an even permutation
The permutation $(1, 4, 5, 6) (2, 1, 5)$ in $S_{6}$ is odd 

The identity permutation $\iota$ in $S_{n}$ is an even permutation since we have $\iota = (1,2)(1,2)$. If $n = 1$ so that we cannot form this product, we define $\iota$ to be even. On the other hand, the permutation $(1, 4, 5, 6) (2, 1, 5)$ in $S_{6}$ can be written as $(1, 4,5,6)(2,1,5) = (1,6)(1,5)(1,4)(2,5)(2,1)$ which has five transpositions, so this is an odd permutation.
