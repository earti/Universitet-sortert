> A [[Permutasjon|permutation]] of a finite [[Mengde|set]] is even or odd according to whether it can be expressed as a product of an even number of [[Transposition|transpositions]] or the product of an odd number of transpositions, respectively.

The identity permutation $$ in Sn is an even permutation since we have ι = (1,2)(1,2). If n = 1sothat we cannot form this product, we define ι to be even. On the other hand, the permutation (1, 4, 5, 6) (2, 1, 5) in S6 can be written as (1, 4,5,6)(2,1,5) = (1,6)(1,5)(1,4)(2,5)(2,1) which has five transpositions, so this is an odd permutation
