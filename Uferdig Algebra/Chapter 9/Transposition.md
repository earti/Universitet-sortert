> A [[Cycle and cycle length|cycle]] of length $2$ is a transposition.

Thus a transposition leaves all elements but two fixed, and maps each of these onto the other. A computation shows that $(a_{1}, a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}) = (a_{1},a_{n})(a_{1},a_{n−1})\cdots(a_{1},a_{3})(a_{1},a_{2})$. Therefore any cycle is a product of transpositions.
