> Let $H$ be a [[Subgroup|subgroup]] of a [[Group|group]] $G$. The number of left [[Coset of subgroup|cosets]] of $H$ in $G$ is the index $(G : H)$ of $H$ in $G$.

The index $(G : H)$ may be finite or infinite. If $G$ is finite, then obviously $(G : H)$ is finite and $(G : H) =|G|/|H|$, since every coset of $H$ contains $|H|$ elements.
