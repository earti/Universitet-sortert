> A ring $\langle R,+,\cdot\rangle$ is a [[Mengde|set]] $R$ together with two [[Binary operation|binary operations]] $+$ and $\cdot$, which we call addition and multiplication, defined on $R$ such that the following axioms are satisfied: 
> R1: $\langle R,+\rangle$ is an [[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Group|group]]. 
> R2: Multiplication is [[Assosiativ|associative]]. 
> R3: For all $a,b,c \in R$, the left distributive law, $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ and the right distributive law $(a + b) \cdot c = (a \cdot c) + (b \cdot c)$ hold.
