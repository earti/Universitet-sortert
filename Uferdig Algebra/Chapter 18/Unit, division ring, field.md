> Let $R$ be a [[Ring|ring]] with [[Unity|unity]] $1 \neq 0$. An element $u$ in $R$ is a unit of $R$ if it has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. If every nonzero element of $R$ is a unit, then $R$ is a division ring (or skew field). A field is a commutative division ring. A noncommutative division ring is called a “strictly skew field”.
